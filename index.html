        <p>Even though we were under difficult circumstances, we reached the real founder of the site. He has now left Discord. We were actually looking for him 2 weeks before opening this site and we finally found him. He said that the site belonged to him on a platform whose name I do not want to mention, but no one reached him. We reached his Instagram through his profile and contacted him. We wrote about the subject. And he sent us a picture, this is his and pixelplace.io Chats with the current admin of 1 year ago. The person named QueenZero is the current admin of pixelplace.io and the other user is the real founder. He claimed that the site belonged to him and that his old friend stole it from him, and he did not say anything else.</p>

                <p>In the video shown, I told the head moderator via DM that I was experiencing racism in Pixelplace. But he did not respond even though he was online. I opened a ticket and reported my problem there. But the head moderator gave me such a response. However, racism is strictly prohibited in the rules of Pixelplace.You can see this in the picture above."They also ban Turkish users from the site. They don't care whether they are criminals or not, whether they break the rules or not, they ban all Turks." There is also a claim like this. We asked Turkish users who visit the pixelplace.io site about the subject, but most of them said that they do not use it anymore, so they do not know anything. Finally, we remembered that the founder of MXO BOT, which has become famous in Pixelplace and used by everyone, is from Turkey, and I tried to talk to him a little bit. We talked and he told us that he no longer uses Pixelplace.io because its audience is so annoying that they ban him every time.</p>
